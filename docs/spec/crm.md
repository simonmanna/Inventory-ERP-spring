# CRM — `crm`

| | |
|---|---|
| Phase | P3c |
| Nest source | `reference/nest-api/src/modules/crm` |
| Routes | 21 — full table: [generated/crm.md](generated/crm.md) |
| Feature flag | always on |
| Java package | `com.inventoryerp.crm` |

## Purpose

Deals pipeline, activities, analytics.

## Functional areas

| Area | Endpoints / scope |
|---|---|
| deals | CRUD, deleted, stage, restore |
| activities | CRUD, upcoming, deleted, complete, restore |
| analytics | pipeline, win-rate, forecast, top-customers, partner/:id |

## Business rules to reproduce exactly

1. Stages lead → qualified → proposal → negotiation → won | lost.
2. Moving to won marks the partner as customer; a won deal cannot be deleted.
3. Listener on `invoice.created` links invoices to open deals of the partner.

Error messages: copy verbatim from the "Error messages" table in the generated spec.

## Events

consumes `invoice.created`.

## Notes and pitfalls

- Kanban UI: `web/src/features/crm/kanban.tsx`.

## Porting checklist

- [ ] Read every file under "Source files to port" in the generated spec
- [ ] Entities tuned (collections/locks/query methods) — generator marker removed where edited
- [ ] DTO records with Bean Validation mirroring class-validator rules
- [ ] Services: rules above + verbatim errors + same transaction/locking boundaries
- [ ] Controllers: same paths/verbs/status/permissions/response shapes
- [ ] Events published/consumed as in Nest
- [ ] Jest specs ported; integration tests; authz + tenant isolation tests
- [ ] Parity scenarios `contract-tests/scenarios/crm-*.json` — zero unexplained diffs
- [ ] Web screens for this module work against Spring (no console errors)
- [ ] `docs/PORT_STATUS.md` updated

## Deviations
